# Arbitary-Precision-Calculator-DS-
This project is a C-based Arbitrary Precision Calculator implemented using Data Structures, where large numbers (beyond built-in data type limits) are represented and processed using a Doubly Linked List.

This project implements an Arbitary Presicion Calcuator in C using Data Structures, specifinally a Doubly Linked List, to perform arithmetic operations on integers of unlimited size.

Unlike standard data types (int, long, long long) which have fixed limits, this calculator stores each digit of a number in a node of a doubly list, enable accurate computation on very large numbers.
